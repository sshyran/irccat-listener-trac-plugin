#summary How to create the plugin.

= How to create the Trac plugin that talks to IRCCat =

First of all, you need setuptools installed. For information on how to install it, see [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPlugins the Trac plugin docs].

Once you have setuptools installed, download the code onto your machine and run

{{{
python setup.py bdist_egg
}}}

You will end up with various directories, one of them being 'dist'. From dist copy the file

{{{
TracIrcCatListener-0.1-pyX.X.egg
}}}

to the plugins directory of your Trac folder. Make sure that whatever user is running Trac has access to the plugin.

That's it!
